Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
The client was a financial institution that desired to expand their customer facing application and contracted us to ensure security and encryption of the application was to industry standards.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I felt I advocated for the most critical vulnerabilities to be handled first. Additionally, I made sure to hold myself to industry standards when programming securely. This was important to ensure that vulnerabilities were not introduced, unknowingly, early on in the application's development that may show or be exploited later on. Security, as a practice, is pertinent to the well-being of the company
as it instills trust and ensures the public can confidently transact knowing that their information is safe.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
What I found helpful with the vulnerability assessment is that it congregates my thoughts to an easily referenceable location to go back to be able to both go back to, and assess further for more vulnerabilities.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Layering a secure code base/practices was the start. On this, I was able to then layer a good cipher for the project and a secure hashing funciton for validation. In the future, I would like to research futher tools to aid in knowing what layers to add beyond what I already know about as well as what mitigation techniques can be used for those discovered vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Good and thorough testing was necessary for functionality as well as having secure programming habits. Upon refactoring, looking in to reports or assessments afterwards to look into any introduced vulnerabilities was critical.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
OWSAP was probably the most useful tool that I was introduced to. The expansiveness of the database and the checker tool was amazing to be able to use and has reusability for future assessments or tasks.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would like to point to the assessments that I generated to show as a bechmark to my progress. This is my initial introduction to this level of security in a program and this assignment serves as a starting point on which my future assessments and knowledge is built upon.
