Client: Gaming Room
Application: Draw It or Lose It
Software Requirements: 
-Multiplayer framework
-Multi-platform (ie IOS and Android) capable
-Storage and retreval of data

For documentation, research was needed to find a solution that best fits the client's software requirements as well as development and maintenance costs. 
I beieve the solution that I have come up with best fits the client requriements with what is able to be accomplished with current technology.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel like the condensing of research was done well and ensuring that the information needing to be conveyed was done so in a way that is understandable by anyone looking over the document. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When developing the code, knowing what to account for is important. Having the requirements that the client has ensures that development was in a focused direction and a solution is present, but just needs to be written.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revisit the requirements for security after progressing further in my degree or personal research. This is one of the most important parts of an application, especially one that is connected to a network.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user is the one, well, using an application. User needs matter because they are the ones who will make or break an applciation. If a user is struggling to use a program or application, it is certain that they will stop using it.
For this case, if the application cannot be run on lower end devices, that user base is excluded, therefore certain design requirements are in place to ensure a wide audience.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I took the approach of planning to optimize what libraries or existing architechture can be leveraged to ensure a quick and smooth development cycle. Such an approach means that any project is not necessarily built from scratch if it is unnecessary to do so.
This tends to be the standard approach for most development teams as unless it is a brand new technology, a team would have some sort of library or framework built for common usage.
