How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
-When interpreting user needs, we need to put ourselves in an objective mindset and try to look at the project through the lens of a user, preferably first time. The implimentation
of of a design that addresses these needs can then come naturally from this perspective thus ensuring we are creating a design that is the most well rounded version possible.

How does creating “user stories” help with this?
-User Stories help with this by putting idea to paper in a way that can be addressed through iteration. If the first concept of a user story is developed and identify shortcomings
or inefficiencies, it can evolve and shift to a concept that better addresses the need it comes from.

How do I approach developing programs? 
-The best way to approach development in an age of Software as a Service or other programs that need to evolve to survive, iterative development wins out over other static 
methodologies. By being able to iterate on a program and having that ability native to the followed methodology we can have it as an anchor to pull us back if we stray.

What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
-The short, functional iterations of a project or idea is antithetical to what I have naturally been doing. I have taken a more rigid, planned approach in the past and in 
an attempt to rectify this, taken a shotgun approach with getting an idea down and functional enough instead. Taking enough time to ensure that the iteration is well
worked and functional to a better degree is that middleground that I have been working towards.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
-Being a good team member is someone who is not afraid to take accountability for their taskings and is willing to communicate what they need to complete it. This is the
best base to build on to be that good team member.
